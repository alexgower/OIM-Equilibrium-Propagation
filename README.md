# Equilibrium Propagation on Oscillator Ising Machines

This repository forks the code from [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03824) "Scaling Equilibrium Prop to Deep ConvNets by Drastically Reducing its Gradient Estimator Bias" and modifies it to use the energy function and dynamics of Oscillator Ising Machines. Results from this code were used in   [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02103) "How to Train an Oscillator Ising Machine using Equilibrium Propagation".
