# Equilibrium Propagation on Oscillator Ising Machines

This repository forks the code producing the results of [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03824) "Scaling Equilibrium Prop to Deep ConvNets by Drastically Reducing its Gradient Estimator Bias".  
This implementation of EP makes extensive use of PyTorch automatic differentiation capability.
